# Using Statistical Hypothesis Testing to Draw Business Insights

## The Data
The NorthWind data is a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company.

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to extract relevant information from the NorthWind database that an executive team at the company could make use of when making business decisions.

## Method

After studying the schema of the NorthWind database, I came up with creative and strategic hypotheses to explore. From there, I used SQL to first figure out which tables contained the information most relevant to my questions and then again to source the data.

My notebook contains statistical analysis of four separate hypotheses as well as the rationale behind them.
